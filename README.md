Healthcare Screening Classification Dashboard â€“ Power BI Project 
 
- This Power BI project is designed to analyze and classify healthcare members based on their screening status, using structured eligibility and demographic data. The dashboard provides actionable insights into screening coverage, disparities, and data quality across diverse populations.
- To identify which eligible members have received recommended health screenings and uncover patterns across language, race, and ethnicity that may influence screening rates.
  
# The Dashboard integrates Multiple Member Attributes :
- Preferred Language & Source Language: Highlights potential communication barriers and language mismatches.
- Original Race & Source Race: Enables race-based segmentation and checks for data consistency.
- Original Ethnicity & Source Ethnicity: Supports culturally sensitive outreach and identifies discrepancies in recorded ethnicity.
  
#  How This Is Helpful 
- This project empowers healthcare organizations to improve screening compliance, reduce disparities, and enhance member engagement through data-driven decision-making.
